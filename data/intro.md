TainanPark Activity Platform (台南公園輕社交平台) is a school project that explores how a digital platform could help teenagers socialize in a way that feels low-pressure, comfortable, and true to their personalities.
Centered around Tainan park, the platform allows teens to discover or host small, vibe based activities like sunset walks, casual photography, or quiet creative meetups using filters such as social intensity, mood, and group size. Instead of pushing loud or highly social events, the design focuses on helping shy or slow to warm up users take their first step into social spaces at their own pace, turning public parks into friendly, approachable places to connect.
