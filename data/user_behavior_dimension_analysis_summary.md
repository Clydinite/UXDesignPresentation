# User Behavior Dimension Analysis Summary

### Core Analysis Framework

The chart maps users across multiple continuous behavioral and psychological spectrums. Instead of looking at users as static types, it analyzes their **state of being** within the park.

### The Eight Key Dimensions

The analysis evaluates each user group based on the following polarities:

1. **Emotional State (正面情緒 ↔ 負面/焦慮)**: Are they relaxed (U10 kids playing) or stressed (U9 anxious commuter)?
2. **Technology Usage (使用科技產品 ↔ 無使用)**: Is the phone a primary interface (U8 student) or non-existent (U1 cycling child)?
3. **Social Grouping (成群結隊 ↔ 獨自一人)**: Are they in a closed group (U2 couple, U7 students) or a solitary island (U12 runner)?
4. **Movement Speed (快速移動 ↔ 靜止狀態)**: Affects the window of opportunity for interaction (U12 runner vs. U4 elder in pavilion).
5. **Focus/Attention (當下專心於某事 ↔ 分心/遊蕩)**: High focus (U5 card players) makes them harder to approach than those wandering aimlessly.
6. **Comfort Level (狀態舒適 ↔ 侷促不安)**: U6/U4 (elders) feel high ownership/comfort; U9 (commuter) feels out of place.
7. **Dwell Time (停留時間長 ↔ 短暫經過)**: Determines if the user is a "resident" of the park or just a "transient."
8. **Facility Interaction (有和公園設施互動 ↔ 無互動)**: Using the park as a tool (U10 playground) vs. using it as a backdrop (U8 student walking through).

### Detailed Cluster Findings

#### Cluster A: High Digital Dependency (The "Digital Island")

* **Users**: U7 (2nd High Students), U8 (University Student), U11 (Parent).
* **Characteristics**: High scores in **Technology Usage** and **Distraction**. Even when in a group (U7), their attention is mediated by reels or messages.
* **Insight**: They use the park physically but are mentally elsewhere. This group has the highest potential for a digital social platform because they are already "half-digital."

#### Cluster B: High Task Focus / Fixed Social Circles

* **Users**: U4 & U5 (Elders), U2 (Couple), U3 (Friends on bench).
* **Characteristics**: High **Dwell Time** and **Comfort**, but very low openness to new social input.
* **Insight**: Their social needs are already met. They are "physically present" but "socially closed."

#### Cluster C: High Physical/Functional Purpose

* **Users**: U12 (Runner), U10 (Kids at playground), U1 (Cycling child).
* **Characteristics**: High **Facility Interaction** and **Purposefulness**.
* **Insight**: They use the park for its intended physical utility. Socializing is secondary or accidental.

#### Cluster D: Negative/High-Pressure Transient

* **Users**: U9 (Sweaty commuter waiting for the bus).
* **Characteristics**: High **Anxiety**, Low **Comfort**, Short **Dwell Time**.
* **Insight**: This user represents the "pain point" of the park—the environment is a source of stress rather than relaxation.

### The Derived Design Insight

The chart proves that there is a **"Social Void"** in the middle. Most users are either in a high-pressure/task-oriented state or a completely closed private state.

**The "Gap" found in the chart:**
The research identifies a lack of **"Low-Pressure, Purposeful Interaction."** This led to the pivot: the platform shouldn't just "push activities," it should allow users to **filter by their psychological capacity for social intensity** (e.g., "I want to be near people but not talk yet").
