# Slide Summary

## Part I: Introduction
1.  **Title Slide**: Introduces the project "Tainan Park Activity Platform" as a UX case study focused on helping shy teenagers socialize in Tainan Park.
2.  **Outline**: Presents the presentation structure: Introduction, Design Methods, UX Solution, and Conclusion.
3.  **Part I Title**: Section header for Project Introduction.
4.  **Site Scanning**: Compares three potential sites (Night Market, Community, Park) to evaluate their suitability for digital transformation.
5.  **Site Decision**: Explains the rationale for choosing Tainan Park, highlighting its "non-purposed" nature and the "digital island" phenomenon.
6.  **Project Goal & Value**: Defines the project goal (low-pressure social platform) and value proposition (lowering threshold vs. changing personality).

## Part II: Design Methods
7.  **Part II Title**: Section header for Design Methods.
8.  **Why not just an App?**: Justifies the research-first approach ("Observe first, Design later") to avoid the "Solution first" fallacy.
9.  **Field Observation: 12 Groups**: Presents 12 distinct user behaviors observed in the park (U1-U12) to illustrate the diversity of the ecosystem.
10. **Field Observation: Real State**: Deep dives into specific examples (U7, U8, U9) to show the "physically present, mentally absent" state and reliance on phones.
11. **Behavior Analysis (1/4): Dimensions**: Introduces the 9 behavioral dimensions used to quantify user observations.
12. **Behavior Analysis (2/4): Data Prep**: Shows the Python code used to standardize data for clustering analysis.
13. **Behavior Analysis (3/4): Algorithm**: Explains the choice of DBSCAN algorithm for clustering user behaviors.
14. **Behavior Analysis (4/4): Results**: Presents the 4 identified user clusters (Groups A, B, C, D) and the "Social Void" insight.
15. **Persona: Yang Zixuan**: Introduces the core persona derived from the "Social Void" - a shy, observing high schooler.
16. **Stakeholder Map**: Visualizes the pressures and influences on the persona (school, family, digital algorithms, park environment).
17. **JTBD**: key "Jobs-To-Be-Done" for the user, translating vague needs into concrete functional goals.
18. **HMW**: "How Might We" questions that brainstorm specific design opportunities based on JTBD.

## Part III: UX Solution
19. **Part III Title**: Section header for UX Design Solution.
20. **Solution Overview**: Highlights the App's visual style (Glassmorphism) and core features (Filters, Host, Profile, Safety).
21. **Story Scene 01**: Persona background - Feeling invisible at school.
22. **Story Scene 02**: Pain point - Social media envy and fear of established circles.
23. **Story Scene 03**: Pain point - Overwhelmed by traditional club recruitment.
24. **Story Scene 04**: Discovery - Finding the platform's poster.
25. **Story Scene 05**: First Contact - Initial exploration of the App.
26. **Story Scene 06**: Hesitation - Encountering high-pressure events.
27. **Story Scene 07**: Control - Using "Social Intensity" filters to find a match.
28. **Solution: Logic**: Technical dive into the filtering code implementation.
29. **Story Scene 08**: Commitment - Joining an event and creating a profile.
30. **Story Scene 09**: Anxiety - Pre-event jitters and reassurance via notifications.
31. **Story Scene 10**: Welcome - Warm, low-pressure reception at the park.
32. **Story Scene 11**: Interaction - Natural bonding through shared activity (photography).
33. **Story Scene 12**: Belonging - Finding a comfortable social circle.
34. **AI Verification**: Explaining the use of Gemini AI for role-playing testing.
35. **AI Suggestion: Profile**: Before/After of profile design based on AI feedback (adding "life" elements).
36. **AI Suggestion: Safety**: New features added based on AI feedback (Safety Map, Friend Notes, Notifications).

## Part IV: Conclusion
37. **Part IV Title**: Section header for Conclusion.
38. **Project Value**: Summarizes value for Users (Social Beginner Village), Park (Third Place for teens), and Society (Cure for loneliness).
39. **Ending**: Final inspiring message.
